In this project, I created a database which stores grocery store transactions. First, I created the four tables called "Orders", "Customer", "SaleItem", and "Item". Next, I wrote the sufficient queries required to populate each table. After that, I assigned the appropriate primary and foreign keys for the tables and created the necessary relationships between them. Finally, I queried the data to find some key insights and metrics. This was done my writing numerous SQL queries. All the queries used to populate and explore the database can be found in the project folders.
